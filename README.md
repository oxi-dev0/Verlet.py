### Overview
This is a Tkinter based cloth/rope simulator in python. This is more of an experiment but feel free to improve upon the code.

------------


### Instructions
Make sure you have tkinter installed into python, then run sim.py with python 3.xx. A window should appear with a welcome message in front of it.
Read the controls then feel free to open one of the example maps.

------------



### Future
- Show % in status bar for loading
- Better and more comments in the code
- Colour scheme, etc for visual aesthetic
- New Stick and Point types (slider, motor, etc)
- Camera control (zooming + movement)
- More example maps
------------


### Issues (In order of importance)
- Not clear on how to use
- Not full commenting
- Rendering Performance
- Simulation Performance
- Dodgy cleanup/reset code
